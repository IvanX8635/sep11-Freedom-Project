The main motive for this project is to make something that exposes the general audience to astronomy. To intrigue them and spread interest. People generally donâ€™t think about space, but space is cool and you will never know if you are in to this field if you have not experienced it. Furthermore, according to www.universetoday.com, scratching and diving into astronomy can help relinquish the puzzles of life. People might have wondered how things work such as how does gravity work or where it comes from. The more you know about this, the more knowledgeable people can be when it comes to figuring things out. According to NASA and SpaceX, astronomy can apply to the future and life in general so there is nothing to lose when it comes to learning(Not a waste of time) because curiosity is always something the world has.

Additionally, people are not knowlegeable about the increasing demand for engineers in future jobs. According to Engineering.com, as the future reveals itself, people are more reliant on engineering and also it extends the advances for the future. People are constantly adapting to new innovations and circumstances as shown in MIT. Technology is very revolutionary, therefore, learning it can help acclimate to the technology in the future.

Both of the fields described are combos since astronomy is the study of basically everything in the physical to the theoretical spectrum and understanding of technology can help us do it. It is fine to even learn one of the fields relevant to this project since they correlate with each other, there can still be advancements made about them and you never know if you like it or not.

Currently this is just the beginning, this project is still at infancy since I am researching the basics of the fields to the more advanced ones. I will congregate all the valid information and research on the aesthetics of making the project "not boring". I will also make sure to include simple contents rather than complex ones.

For this reason, a skill that is developing is not only learning about how innovations work, but how they are important for the future. Not only that, another skill is being a diligent researching which can help you research faster and multitask more. Also NASA, SpaceX, Engineering.com, MIT are all valid resources to derive information from since they have been verified and acquainted well enough.
