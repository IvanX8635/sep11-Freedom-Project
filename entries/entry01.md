The main motive for this project is to make something that exposes the general audience to astronomy. To intrigue them and spread interest. People generally donâ€™t think about space, but space is cool and you will never know if you are in to this field if you have not experience it. Furthermore, according to www.universetoday.com, scratching and diving into astronomy can help relinquish the puzzles of life. People might have wondered how things work such as how does gravity work or where it comes from. The more you know about this, the more knowledgable people can be when it comes to figuring things out. According to NASA and SpaceX, astronomy can apply to the future and life in general so there is nothing to lose when it comes to learning(Not a waste of time) because curiousity is always something the world has.

Additionally, people are not knowlegible about the increasing demand for engineers in future jobs. According to Engineering.com, as the future reveals itself, people are more reliant on engineering and also it extends the advances for the future. People are constantly adapting to new innovations and circumstances and technology is revolutionary.



Both of the fields described are combos since astronomy is the study of basically everything in the physical to the theoretical spectrum and understanding of technology can help us do it. It is fine to do even one of the fields relevant to this project since they correlate with each other, there can still be advancements made about them.
